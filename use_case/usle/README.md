# Universal Soil Loss Equation
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Soil_Loss_Equation


Equation: A = R * K * L * S * C * P

With:

- A: Long-term average annual soil loss
- R: Rainfall erosivity factor
- K: Soil erodibility factor
- L: Topographic factor: slope length
- S: Topographic factor: slope gradient
- C: Cropping management factor
- P: Concervation practices factor

TODO:
- Verify right values end up in the LUE dataset. https://github.com/computationalgeography/lue/issues/485
- Work on calculations
- Add support for directly reading and writing GDAL supported rasters.
- Automate download of all required data for certain part of the world
